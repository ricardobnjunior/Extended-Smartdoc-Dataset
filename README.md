## Smartdoc Dataset 2

This repository introduces the dataset named Smartdoc Dataset 2.
This is a dataset derived from Standard Smartdoc Dataset (SSD) <http://smartdoc.univ-lr.fr/>.

<br>

While SSD uses five backgrounds with 5 document variations, the dataset proposed here,
presents the same documents already presented in SSD with a variety of 213 different backgrounds, increasing the
the complexity of the dataset, making it a real-world problem.
